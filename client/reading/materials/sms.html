            is bad because...

            So, you believe using two-factor authentication is
            way more secure? Yes and No.

            For "Yes", you can definitely make your account safer.
            But "No", if your two-factor authentication code is 
            sent by SMS, it will be stolen and your account will
            possibly be gone in a few seconds.

        <h3>Solution (For devs)</h3>
        <pre>
            You can use end-to-end encrypted messaging app, email
            and many more to protect your code.

            Some of the examples include "Whatsapp", "Line" and so
            on. If you love games, I'm sure you have used "Steam"
            as well. Steam has an app for two-factor authentication
            as well. 
            
            Sending the codes through email is not a bad option as
            well (as long as you trust the service provider, eg. 
            Google for Gmail).
