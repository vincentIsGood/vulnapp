            HTTP vs HTTPS
        </h2>
        <h3>1. HTTP</h3>
        <pre>
            To understand HTTP vs HTTPS, consider the investigation I
            have conducted.
            
            First, I load the page with normal HTTP. URL used...
            http://127.0.0.1/vulnapp/client/
        </pre>
        <img src="./images/http_webpage.png" alt="">
        <pre>
            Next, I will record the traffic using Wireshark and see if 
            the content can be understood or not
        </pre>
        <img src="./images/http_wireshark.png" alt="">
        <pre>
            As you can see, there are lots of traffic going on. But the one 
            which stands out is the GET request and the 200 OK response 
            from the web server.

            Let's see what we have inside the 200 OK response.
        </pre>

            Since the html code shows as plaintext, if you post your sensitive
            information through HTTP, hackers online are willing to take it.
        </pre>

        <h3>2. HTTPS</h3>
        <pre>
            What should I use then? You should use HTTPS because it is "secured"
            as the name says it HTTP<b>S</b>. Let's see what happens if we request
            an HTTPS page.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            There is nothing special here except for the TLS handshake which 
            starts whenever "client hello" is sent. I would like to show you 
            the plaintext html sent by the web server. But I can't because 
            everything is encrypted.
        </pre>

            You must be yelling out loud what is the "Application Data". Alright,
            this is what you can see.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            See? They are encrypted which means HTTPS is definitely safer. 
            Good luck trying to crack the encrypted data.
